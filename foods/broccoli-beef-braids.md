# Broccoli Beef Braids

## Ingredients

- 1 lb (450 g) ground beef
- 1/2 cup onion, chopped
- 3 cups frozen broccoli, chopped
- 1 cup shredded cheese
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- 2 tubes refrigerated crescent rolls

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain.
3. Stir in broccoli, cheese, sour cream, salt and pepper. Heat through.
4. Unroll a tube of crescent dough onto a greased baking sheet; form into a 12x8-in. rectangle, sealing seams and perforations. Spoon half the beef mixture lengthwise down the center third of the rectangle.
5. On each long side, cut 1-in.-wide strips at an angle, from the edge to about 3 in. into the center. Fold 1 strip from each side over filling, pinching ends together; repeat.
6. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make second braid. Bake 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
